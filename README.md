## Hello There! ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸš€ About Me
I am Halil Alper YalÃ§Ä±n, a mid-level game developer with three years of professional working experience and many more coding experience from the past. I like to code in C# and Luau, I usually use Unity or Roblox as my main game engine.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an unannounced Roblox project which I'll publish soon.
- ðŸŒ± Meanwhile Iâ€™m also learning better AI techniques to use in games.
